The esp collector

ESP_COLLECT v2012 (2020-12) by Jorge Barba, Carlos Sierra, Rodrigo Righetti and Mauro Pagano

ESP_COLLECT is a "free to use" script that collects Oracle Database(s) Requirements
from a Host. Since most of the metadata collected comes from DBA_HIST and ASH Views,
the system where it runs must have a valid Oracle Diagnostics Pack License.

Steps

1. Connect to a Host as oracle. 

2. Unzip esp_collect-master.zip and navigate to esp_collect-master directory.

3. Execute shell script corresponding to your system (linux, solaris, aix):

   $ unzip esp_collect-master.zip
   $ cd esp_collect-master
   $ sh run_esp_master_linux.sh

4. Provide to requestor all files generated by this script on current directory 
   (i.e. escp_output.zip)

Notes

1. Ignore possible errors like: 

   "SP2-0310: unable to open file "--sql/..."
   "ORA-01219: database not open:..."
   "ORA-00604: error occurred at recursive SQL..."
   "SP2-0546: User requested Interrupt or EOF detected."

2. To collect requirements for just one database, connect into SQL*Plus as SYS or user 
   with query access to the data dictionary (i.e. DBA), then execute sql/esp_master.sql.
